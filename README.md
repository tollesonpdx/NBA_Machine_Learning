# NBA_Machine_Learning
## Machine Learning Project for NBA Prediction

### This project is the result of all four team members working in parallel. Implementations of the four machine learning algorithms: support vector machines (SVM), logistic regression, random forest, and naiÌˆve Bayes are in separate Python files. The [final report](Report/Bolton_Rademacher_Tolleson_Lancaster_Report.pdf) detailing the results of each algorithm and also a comparion of results between the four is located [HERE](Report/Bolton_Rademacher_Tolleson_Lancaster_Report.pdf).
